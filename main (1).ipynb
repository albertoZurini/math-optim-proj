    "# Problem description\n",
    "\n",
    "- We have a set of $J={1,...,n}$ of electric vehicle charging demands to be scheduled on a set of chargers.\n",
    "- At each time, a charger can only charge one vehicle, and a vehicle can only be charged by one charger.\n",
    "- Each charger $i$ delivers a constant power $w_i$ (kW).\n",
    "- The total power that can be delivered by all chargers simultaneously must not exceed $w_G$ (kW), the power grid capacity.\n",
    "- The charging demand of each vehicle $j$ is characterized by an arrival time $r_j$ , a departure time $d_j$ , and required energy $e_j$ (kWh).\n",
    "- Each charging demand j has to be assigned to one charger, and its energy requirement must be fulfilled before the departure.\n",
    "  - The vehicle $j$ uninterruptedly occupies the charger, and the parking space, from its arrival time $r_j$ to its departure time $d_j$ and cannot be moved or unplugged during this time.\n",
    "  - The vehicle can charge preemptively.\n",
    "  - Even if j completes charging before dj , it still occupies the charger until it departs.\n",
    "- We divide the scheduling time horizon $H$ into $T$ time slots of equal length $\\tau$.\n",
    "  - $r_j$ and $d_j$ are multiple of $\\tau$.\n",
    "- We assume linear charging time of vehicles, meaning that the charging time $p_{ij}$ of vehicle $j$ on a charger $i$ is equal to $\\frac{e_j}{w_i}$.\n",
    "  - $p_{ij}$ is the number of time slots needed to satisfy $j$ rounded to the nearest integer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The objective is to find a feasible schedule with the minimum grid capacity $w_G$.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Identical charges\n",
    "instance of the electric vehicle charging problem with identical chargers, each delivering a constant power $w$ (kW), and the number of chargers is not fixed in advance. we address the problem of the minimum number of chargers needed to charge all vehicles before minimizing the capacity of the grid.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimum number of chargers\n",
    "\n",
    "- Charging a vehicle j requires the assignment of an available charger to that vehicle for an uninterrupted period length $[rj , dj)$.\n",
    "  - We assume that the energy demand of vehicle j can be fulfilled during the plugging time interval\n",
    "- This problem is equivalent to finding the minimum number of machines that can handle all jobs in the fixed interval scheduling problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let $z$ be the maximum number of charging demands that overlap at the same time. This means that at some moment in time, there are $z$ different demands that all require charging simultaneously.\n",
    "The minimum number of identical chargers needed to plug n electric vehicles is equal to $z$."
